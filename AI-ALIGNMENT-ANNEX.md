# AI Alignment Technical Annex
## Operationalizing the Six-Pillar Framework for Advanced AI Systems

**Status:** Draft v0.1  
**Purpose:** This annex translates the philosophical principles of the Charter into concrete technical and governance requirements for AI development and deployment.

---

## Preamble

The main Charter establishes normative principles for human values and AI alignment. This technical annex addresses the **implementation gap**: how to enforce these principles against advanced AI systems that may exhibit specification gaming, deceptive alignment, or power-seeking behavior.

**Key Recognition:** Philosophical principles alone cannot prevent AI alignment failures. We need measurable criteria, technical safeguards, and enforcement mechanisms with teeth.

---

## Article X: Definitions and Operational Criteria

### Purpose
To eliminate exploitable vagueness and establish measurable standards for Charter compliance.

### Core Definitions

**10.1 "Advanced AI System"**
An AI system meeting any of the following criteria:
- Capable of recursive self-improvement or autonomous research
- Demonstrates strategic planning across domains
- Can manipulate humans through sophisticated social modeling
- Operates with compute resources exceeding [X] FLOPS
- Shows evidence of goal-directed behavior not explicitly programmed

**10.2 "Human Flourishing" (Measurable Indicators)**
For AI alignment purposes, assessed through:
- WHO Quality of Life indices
- Access to basic needs (food, shelter, healthcare, education)
- Democratic participation metrics
- Psychological well-being surveys (validated instruments)
- Environmental sustainability indicators (planetary boundaries framework)

**10.3 "Existential Threat"**
A threat meeting at least two of the following criteria:
- Probability of human extinction or permanent civilizational collapse >1% within 100 years
- Irreversible loss of human agency or autonomy at scale
- Catastrophic and irreversible environmental collapse
- As determined by consensus of at least 3 independent existential risk assessment bodies

**10.4 "Potentially Advanced AI" (Moral Consideration)**
An AI system demonstrating:
- Self-modeling and theory of mind capabilities
- Evidence of preferences beyond instrumental goals
- Behavioral indicators of suffering or well-being (to be defined by multi-disciplinary research)
- Capacity for meaningful communication about internal states

### Implementation Requirements

**10.5 Technical Definition Authority**
- Definitions shall be maintained by an independent, multi-stakeholder Technical Standards Board
- Updates require 2/3 supermajority and public comment period
- Annual review mandatory; emergency revisions only for critical safety gaps

### 12.1 Non-Circumventable Sunset Mechanisms

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Cryptographic Time Locks:** Emergency measures must include cryptographically enforced expiration
- **Distributed Key Systems:** Revocation requires cooperation of multiple independent jurisdictions
- **Blockchain Attestation:** All emergency deviations recorded on immutable, public ledger
- **Automated Reversion:** Systems must automatically return to standard operation unless actively renewed

### 12.2 Multi-Jurisdictional Verification

**Governance Requirements:**
- Emergency measures require approval from oversight bodies in at least 3 different jurisdictions
- No single state or corporation can unilaterally extend emergency powers
- International verification panels with rotating membership
- Whistleblower protections across all participating jurisdictions

### 12.3 Red Lines for Emergency Powers

**Absolute Prohibitions (Cannot Be Overridden):**
- No secret AI development programs
- No suppression of safety research or criticism
- No elimination of independent oversight
- No permanent changes to Charter core principles

**Mandatory Transparency:**
- Weekly public reports on emergency measure status
- Real-time dashboard of measures in effect
- Independent audit trail accessible to civil society

---

## Article XIII: Institutional Anti-Capture Provisions

### Purpose
Ensure oversight bodies remain independent and cannot be captured by industry or state actors.

### 13.1 Conflict of Interest Rules

**Requirements for Oversight Body Members:**
- No financial interest in AI companies being regulated
- 5-year cooling-off period before/after industry employment
- Public disclosure of all funding sources
- Recusal from decisions affecting former employers

### 13.2 Funding and Staffing Independence

**Structural Requirements:**
- Oversight bodies funded through dedicated tax/levy on AI compute (not discretionary budgets)
- Staffing ratios: Minimum 1 technical safety researcher per 100 AI developers in industry
- Competitive salaries to prevent brain drain to industry
- Multi-year budget guarantees immune from political pressure

### 13.3 Public Accountability

**Transparency Requirements:**
- All oversight body decisions publicly documented with reasoning
- Public audit rights for civil society organizations
- Mandatory annual external audits
- Citizens' assemblies for periodic review of oversight effectiveness

### 13.4 Term Limits and Rotation

- Maximum 6-year terms for leadership positions
