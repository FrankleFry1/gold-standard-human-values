# AI Prompt Templates for the Gold Standard Framework

These templates demonstrate how to integrate the six pillars into AI interactions, such as evaluating decisions or generating responses. Use them with LLMs (e.g., Grok, ChatGPT) to ensure outputs align with the framework. Copy and customize as needed.

## Basic Evaluation Template
Use this to assess any issue or decision through the pillars.

Evaluate [describe the decision, issue, or scenario here, e.g., 'deploying an AI system for hiring'] through the six pillars of the Gold Standard for Human Values:

Curiosity and Truth-Seeking: Assess based on evidence, intellectual humility, and inclusion of diverse knowledge.
Empathy and Mutual Flourishing: Consider minimization of suffering, equity, and balance between outcomes and rights.
Dignity and Agency: Evaluate inherent worth, autonomy, participatory governance, and accountability.
Sustainability and Long-Term Stewardship: Weigh intergenerational impacts, ecological balance, and technological alignment.
Adaptability and Diversity: Check for cultural pluralism, moral evolution, and resilience.
Integrity and Responsibility: Ensure alignment of intentions and actions, moral courage, and reconciliation.

Provide a balanced analysis, highlight tensions, and recommend actions. Cite any relevant articles from the charter.

**Example Output (Hypothetical from an LLM):**  
- Curiosity: Ensure hiring data is evidence-based and open to revision.  
- Empathy: Mitigate biases that could cause unfair suffering.  
- ... (and so on).

## Variation for AI Governance Policy
Tailored for policy or regulation discussions.
Draft a policy recommendation for [topic, e.g., 'AI in healthcare'] using the six pillars:

Curiosity: Incorporate evidence-based inquiry and epistemic justice.
Empathy: Prioritize reducing suffering and extending moral consideration to patients/AIs.
Dignity: Protect autonomy and ensure participatory decision-making.
Sustainability: Focus on long-term health system resilience.
Adaptability: Allow for cultural diversity and ethical evolution.
Integrity: Build in accountability and forgiveness mechanisms.

Address potential tensions (e.g., innovation vs. safety) and suggest implementation pathways from Article VIII.

## Variation for Ethical Dilemma Resolution

For navigating real-world conflicts.
Resolve this ethical dilemma [describe dilemma, e.g., 'balancing user privacy with AI personalization'] via the pillars:
1-6: [As above, analyze each pillar].
Apply Article VII for tensions, e.g., agency vs. flourishing. Propose safeguards if compromises are needed.

## Tips for Use
- **Customization:** Replace placeholders with specifics for better results.
- **Chaining:** Feed LLM outputs back into the template for iteration.
- **Testing:** Try with open dilemmas from AI ethics forums to refine.
