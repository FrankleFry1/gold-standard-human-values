# Emergency Procedures: Enforceable Guidelines

This document tightens Article VII's emergency compromise language into step-by-step procedures, ensuring proportionality and accountability without modifying the charter's core declarations.

## Activation Threshold
- Must demonstrate clear, evidence-based existential threat (e.g., AI misalignment causing widespread harm), verified by independent oversight (per OVERSIGHT_STRUCTURE.md).

## Enforceable Steps
1. **Proposal Phase**: Submit detailed rationale to a democratic body (e.g., ethics commission), including impact on each pillar and metrics forecast (link to METRICS.md).
2. **Safeguard Application**:
   - **Proportionality**: Limit scope to minimum needed; audit by third party.
   - **Temporality**: Set explicit end date (max 6 months); auto-terminate if threat resolves.
   - **Authorization**: Require 2/3 majority vote with minority reports.
   - **Oversight**: Assign independent monitors with veto power.
   - **Transparency**: Public disclosure of non-sensitive details; full logs post-event.
   - **Sunset/Recovery**: Mandatory review within 30 days post-end; include reconciliation for moral residue.
3. **Implementation**: Execute via certified protocols (CERTIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md); track via anti-gaming methods.
4. **Post-Action**: Truth and reconciliation process; update framework if lessons emerge.

## Non-Compromisable Elements
- Reaffirm charter inviolables (e.g., no torture); violations trigger automatic revocation.

Enforce via auditsâ€”welcome refinements to make this more robust.
