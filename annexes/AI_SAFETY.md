# Annex: AI Safety and Technical Controls

This annex extends the Gold Standard framework for AI-specific applications, building on Article IV (Sustainability and Stewardship) and Article VII (Navigating Tensions). It provides technical safeguards without altering the core charter's philosophy.

## Core Principles
- Align AI development with all six pillars, prioritizing curiosity (evidence-based safety) and integrity (transparent controls).

## Technical Controls
1. **Value Alignment Mechanisms**: Use techniques like Constitutional AI to embed pillars in model training (e.g., reward functions scoring outputs on empathy and dignity).
2. **Interpretability Requirements**: Mandate tools like SHAP or attention maps to explain decisions, ensuring epistemic openness.
3. **Containment and Shutdown**: Implement scalable off-switches and sandboxing, with emergency protocols (link to operations/EMERGENCY_PROTOCOL.md).
4. **Bias and Risk Mitigation**: Regular audits using metrics from /metrics/METRICS.md; anti-gaming via diverse training data.
5. **Deployment Gates**: Certify models via CERTIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md before release, with red-teaming for adversarial robustness.

## Integration Guidance
- For base models: Incorporate during pre-training (e.g., filter datasets for sustainability).
- Tensions: If safety controls limit agency (e.g., restricting experimental AI), apply Article VII safeguards.
