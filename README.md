# A Six-Pillar Framework for AI Alignment and Human Values

**An experimental approach to ethics development through human-AI collaboration**

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive ethical framework designed to address AI alignment challenges and navigate value conflicts in an increasingly AI-integrated world. It emerged from a unique methodological experiment: iterative collaboration between a human researcher and four frontier AI systems (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini).

**Core Question:** How do we develop ethical frameworks for AI alignment when humanity has never achieved consensus on values?

**Key Innovation:** The framework explicitly addresses how to handle tensions *between* principles—not just what the principles are.

## The Six Pillars

1. **Curiosity and Truth-Seeking** - Evidence-based reasoning, intellectual humility, and diverse paths to meaning
2. **Empathy and Mutual Flourishing** - Minimizing suffering, expanding moral consideration, balancing outcomes and rights
3. **Dignity and Agency** - Inherent worth, autonomy, participatory governance, and accountability
4. **Sustainability and Long-Term Stewardship** - Intergenerational justice, ecological balance, technological alignment
5. **Adaptability and Diversity** - Cultural pluralism, moral evolution, resilience through diversity
6. **Integrity and Responsibility** - Aligning words and deeds, moral courage, accountability systems

## What Makes This Different

### Explicit Tension Navigation
Most ethical frameworks list principles but struggle when they conflict. This framework includes detailed guidance (Article VII) on navigating common tensions:
- Curiosity vs. Empathy (when truth-seeking causes harm)
- Sustainability vs. Present Well-Being (when long-term survival requires sacrifice)
- Dignity/Agency vs. Collective Flourishing (when individual freedom conflicts with social good)
- **Existential Tensions** (when defending principles requires compromising them)

### Multi-AI Collaboration Methodology
This framework was developed through structured dialogue with four different AI systems, each with distinct training approaches and constitutional principles:

- **Claude (Anthropic):** Constitutional AI approach, emphasis on harmlessness
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** RLHF optimization, emphasis on helpfulness
- **Grok (xAI):** "Maximum truth-seeking" positioning, less filtered
- **Gemini (Google):** Different training corpus and safety guidelines

**The process:**
1. I posed the core alignment question to each AI independently
2. Each proposed frameworks with different emphases and gaps
3. I identified convergences (robust principles) and divergences (requiring human judgment)
4. Through iterative refinement, I synthesized across perspectives
5. Where AIs disagreed, I pushed for resolution or explicit acknowledgment
6. The human role: asking hard questions, identifying missing elements, making final judgment calls

**Why this matters:** Using multiple AIs reduces single-system bias and models the framework's own principle of diverse dialogue leading to better outcomes.

## Document Structure

The framework is formatted as a **Formal Charter** with:
- **Preamble** - Philosophical foundation and scope
- **Articles I-VI** - The Six Pillars (each with principles, commitments, and rationale)
- **Article VII** - Navigating tensions between pillars, including existential threats
- **Article VIII** - Implementation pathways
- **Article IX** - Conclusion and affirmation

**[Read the full Charter](./CHARTER.md)**

## Key Contributions

### 1. Article VII, Section B: Existential Tensions
Perhaps the most novel element—guidance on when defending ethical principles requires temporary deviation from those principles. Includes:
- Seven safeguards for emergency compromises (proportionality, temporality, democratic authorization, oversight, transparency, sunset clauses, moral residue recognition)
- What can *never* be compromised (prohibition of torture/genocide, fundamental equality, right to challenge authority)
- Warning against abuse of "existential" rhetoric

### 2. Integration of Economic Justice
Explicit acknowledgment (Article III) that dignity and agency require addressing resource constraints and economic systems—not just abstract rights.

### 3. Reconciliation and Forgiveness
Unlike many frameworks that focus only on punishment, this includes commitment to repairing harm and reintegrating after ethical failures (Article VI).

## Intended Applications

This framework could inform:

- **Constitutional AI development** - Providing richer value specifications for training
- **AI governance policy** - Guiding regulation that balances innovation and safety
- **Institutional ethics review** - Framework for assessing AI deployment decisions
- **Cross-cultural dialogue** - Common ground for values discussions across traditions
- **Education** - Teaching ethical reasoning in the AI age

## Limitations and Acknowledgments

**This framework is incomplete and culturally situated:**

- Emerged primarily from Western philosophical traditions (Enlightenment liberalism, utilitarianism, deontology)
- Training data for all four AIs is predominantly English-language and Western-centric
- Human synthesizer (me) brings own cultural assumptions and blind spots
- Needs critique from non-Western philosophical traditions
- Implementation mechanisms are underspecified

**This is explicitly version 1.0.** The framework itself calls for adaptation based on evidence and experience.

## How to Contribute

I'm seeking rigorous critique and improvement:

### Specific Questions

1. **For AI safety researchers:** Could this inform Constitutional AI or reward modeling approaches? Where does it fail under adversarial pressure?

2. **For philosophers:** What cultural assumptions am I missing? Which philosophical traditions would critique this framework?

3. **For policymakers:** Is this practical for actual governance decisions? What real-world case breaks it?

4. **For implementers:** How would you operationalize these principles in an organization?

5. **For anyone:** What's the most important thing missing?

### Ways to Contribute

- **Open an Issue** - Point out flaws, gaps, or unclear sections
- **Pull Request** - Suggest specific improvements to the Charter text
- **Discussions** - Share how you'd apply this to real dilemmas
- **Translations** - Help make this accessible in other languages
- **Case Studies** - Test the framework against actual AI ethics dilemmas

**All contributions welcome.** The goal is refinement through dialogue, not defense of a fixed position.

## Methodology Transparency

### What Worked in Multi-AI Collaboration

- **Complementary strengths:** Each AI emphasized different principles (Grok pushed on curiosity/truth, Claude on dignity/integrity, etc.)
- **Bias detection:** When all four agreed strongly, likely a robust principle; when they diverged, required human judgment
- **Iterative refinement:** Each conversation improved on the last

### What Was Difficult

- **Synthesis burden:** Human role in resolving contradictions was significant
- **Style homogenization:** AIs tend toward similar formal language despite different "personalities"
- **Verification:** Hard to know if convergence reflects training data overlap vs. genuine principle strength

### What I'd Change Next Time

- More structured disagreement protocols
- Explicit red-teaming phase (have AIs attack the framework)
- Earlier involvement of human domain experts
- Cross-cultural validation throughout, not just at the end
