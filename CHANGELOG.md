# Changelog

All notable changes to this framework will be documented in this file.

## [v2.0-technical-annex] - 2025-01-XX (In Development)

### Added
- **AI-ALIGNMENT-ANNEX.md** - Technical implementation layer for AI systems
  - Article X: Operational definitions (eliminates exploitable vagueness)
  - Article XI: AI-specific failure mode prevention
  - Article XII: Enhanced emergency safeguards (non-circumventable mechanisms)
  - Article XIII: Institutional anti-capture provisions
  - Article XIV: Staged deployment and capability licensing
  - Article XV: Liability and enforcement framework
  - Article XVI: Research and adaptation requirements

### Context
Response to critique identifying implementation gap between philosophical principles and enforceable governance. The Charter alone lacks:
- Measurable criteria for compliance
- Technical safeguards against specification gaming, deceptive alignment
- Enforcement mechanisms with teeth
- Protections against regulatory capture

### Status
- Charter (v1.0): Stable, ready for philosophical critique
- Technical Annex (v0.1): Draft requiring expert review

### Seeking Feedback On
1. Are operational definitions measurable and non-gameable?
2. What AI failure modes are missing?
3. Are anti-capture provisions sufficient?
4. How to prevent the Annex itself from being watered down?

## [v1.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Initial Release
- Six-Pillar Framework (Articles I-VI)
- Article VII: Navigating Tensions Between Pillars
- Article VIII: Implementation Pathways
- Article IX: Conclusion and Affirmation

### Methodology
Developed through multi-AI collaboration (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini) over several months, synthesizing insights from moral philosophy, AI safety research, and democratic theory.

### Known Limitations
- Western-centric philosophical foundations
- Implementation mechanisms underspecified
- Technical requirements for AI systems not detailed
